# Meeting with Dr. Kimura

Youssef's notes on the meeting with Dr. Kimura on 12/5/2020.

## Interesting facts

Sarah has a psychology degree.

Jennifer's family has four engineers.

David used to work in a pharmacy.

## Dr. Kimura's Advice

Dr. Kimura will treat us as engineers. Dr. Kimura likes to see the transformation from student to engineer. Dr. Kimura wants us to pay attention to the big picture and not just our individual tasks. Be aware of how the team is doing. Be willing to help if someone is busy.

He wants us to learn to ask the right questions. That is how engineers solve problems. He advises us to ask questions and not worry about whether the question is stupid or not.

Always doubt yourself and double check your work. If you think you found the right answer, have someone review your work.

Don't depend and wait upon email. If you don't get a response, be ready to call or take another action. We don't have a lot of time.

Dr. Kimura is our ally and is here to help us fight our enemies, minions of mother nature.

### Our enemies

1. Time
2. Murphy's law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
3. Ourselves. Are we underestimating the time commitment?

### Our Ally's preferred contact method

Email. If you want to contact Dr. Kimura, email him. He usually responds within a day. If he doesn't respond within the day, email again.

## The Capstone

The capstone is made to simulate working at a real company. It is intended to teach us to think like engineers.

### Grading

Dr. Kimura is responsible for grading our capstone. The hierarchy is established.

We will be graded as a team. Then he will adjust points individually.

We work as a team. The proposal and the contract are team work. The ethics paper is the only  individual part.

If one person is not doing his/her work, he/she will be flunked. That said, he is willing to refer us if we do well.

#### Capstone 1:

- Contract
- Proposal
- Ethics paper

#### Capstone 2:

- Build the project. If we don't finish it, we will take another quarter.
- Final report. You say what you did. An update of the proposal. 
- Oral capstone presentation.

### The contract

It clearly defines the positions in this project. It identifies the clients, the professors, and us. The contract specifies who we contact if we need clarifications on the project. The most important section in the contract is the deliverables. The deliverables are what we are graded on.

The contract is final. You can't go back after you sign it.

#### Dr. Kimura advice

Investigate approaches. Don't bite two much. But don't bite off too little. He will make sure the project is reasonable. He decides the scope. He will not sign the contract unless he thinks we have a good capstone project.

Get the contract out of the way quickly, so we can focus on the proposal. The proposal is a heavy document.

The number of pages doesn't matter. Be as detailed as you want to.

Finish it by the second week of winter at the latest.

### The proposal

Tier 1 design: A high-level design of the inhaler

Tier 2 design: A detailed design for the Hardware and software.

BOM: Bill of Material. Be careful with the budget.

#### Dr. Kimura advice

Put spec sheets in the Appendices.

Put the links in the BOM.

Finish the proposal by the beginning of March at the latest.

### Ethics Paper

Ethics are an integral part of engineering. We need to write a paper on ethics because of the ABET requirements.

#### Dr. Kimura advice

It is easier to write on when people weren't ethical.

Show that you understand that ethics is an important part of engineering.

Send early drafts to get feedback and focus the discussion.

Don't wait until the end of the quarter to do it. Do it early. Write the paper now.

### Building the project

If we don't finish it, we are delayed a quarter.

Make a PCB capable of sensing the amount of inhaler used/expelled and can send the information to the phone. Figure out how long we want it to last.

### Final Report

An extension of the proposal.

### Presentation

Have it ready in the beginning of march.

## Questions

Are you interested in joining our discord? Seems no.

What does he mean by not to depend on email? Don't use it blindly. Your biggest challenge is time. Follow up. Consider using the phone.

How to save time? Start early. Start capstone two before we end capstone one. Work in the break.

Discuss the design, Dr. Dimpsey's advice, and Dr. Peng's advice.

How do we contact him? Email is fine. If we need to, we can call him or text him. He prefers email and he organizes different teams into different folders. If he doesn't respond quickly, email again. Don't wait more than a day.

Who is our technical-client-advisor?

How much time can we expect to spend? His guess: consider it a five to six credit hour course.

Can we power the inhaler with vibration?

Can we have them buy the parts before the winter break?

## Impressions

He thinks I'm overloading myself. I think he also thinks I hog credit. But I like him. He seems committed.

Why does he hate zoom? A bias?

If we delay buying the microprocessor, I'm worried we won't have enough time to learn it. I will just buy it with my money. Wasting time is much more expensive than wasting money. What? Will we write code and simulate it in our brains?

It is the project lead's responsibility to distribute the work and make sure the team is working together.

## TODO:

1. Get the paper that was submitted to Amazon Catalyst. Ask Dr. Paparella and Dr. Mourad. Mention that Dr. Kimura is the capstone advisor. Find out who the student was and if we can get in touch with the student.
2. Send Dr. Kimura a list of all the contacts and positions. Including the ME team and the professors.
3. Send Dr. Kimura the ME Google Drive. Send a Zip file, and add him to the drive or ask Dr. Hannachi to add him.
4. Begin a conversation with the professors. What exactly do they want from our team. Look for who (among the professors) to work with to finetune the contract. Let that person know we are working on the contract. Explain what we need for the capstone contract.
5. Ask the professors what are their expectations? What do they want for the prototype? We define a prototype as the simplest working product that is not necessarily good enough to put in the market.
6. Expand upon the challenges in the "design".
