# Meeting with Dr. Dimpsey on 12/3/2020

I asked Dr. Dimpsey for advice on developing the App. Dr. Dimpsey said he has no experience with developing phone apps. However, he gave me his impressions, assumptions, and his approach to building things he doesn't have experience with.

Dr. Dimpsey assumes Cross-Platform app-development is more difficult than native application. Dr. Dimpsey wouldn't try going cross-platform. He will focus on Android and build an end-to-end solution.

After building an end-to-end solution, he would decide whether to go cross-platform or not. He would try building the same App with a cross-platform tool and see how difficult or not it is. Ultimately, our goal is to finish the capstone. Cross-platform Apps are a stretch goal.

Dr. Dimpsey recommends building the App for the same use-case as ours and not something like connecting to a headset because cross-platform tools are likely to have pre-made solutions for something like connecting to a headset.

For example, try to build an android app that connects to the esp32. Try to avoid canned solutions because Cross-Platform tools may have a prebuilt solution for that.
